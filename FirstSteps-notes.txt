A recurring theme will be the ways in which intensional constructions, while talking about situations other than the actual here and now, tie such talk back to that very actual here and now. This shows up first in the determination of exactly *what* situations we're being taken to. And then, there are many ways in which the claim about those situations is put in terms that depend on how things are here.

[That's very awkwardly put. The idea is cool but I have to find a better way of conveying it.]

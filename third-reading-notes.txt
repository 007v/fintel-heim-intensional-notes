Romoli & Sudo:

John wants to meet the wife of the president.

a. Wife de dicto; president de re: The president, Barack Obama, is such
that John wants to meet his wife, whoever she may be.

b. Both de re: The wife of the president, Michelle Obama, is such that
John wants to meet her, though perhaps he does not even know she’s
the wife of the president.

c. Both de dicto: John wants to meet whoever the wife of the current
president is, though perhaps he does not even know who the president
is, or who his wife is.

d. Wife de re; president de dicto: #John believes some particular woman
to be the wife of the president, but is mistaken about the president himself. For instance, John is an American in London and sees the prime minister and his wife, but mistakenly believes the prime minister to be the (non-existent) president of the United Kingdom.

Intensional Semantics
=====================

Lecture notes on intensional semantics by Kai von Fintel and Irene Heim

These notes have been shared with the semantics community for years. We are now making the source files available as well. There will be revisions for the Spring 2016 semester. More notes to come.

The Spring 2011 edition is still [available](https://github.com/fintelkai/fintel-heim-intensional-notes/blob/master/fintel-heim-2011-intensional.pdf).

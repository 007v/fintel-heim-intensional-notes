A note about these lecture notes:

\plainbreak{1} 

The notes for this course have been evolving for years now, starting
with some old notes from the early 1990s by Angelika Kratzer, Irene
Heim, and myself, which have since been modified and expanded many
times by Irene or myself. Because this version of the notes has not
been seen by my co-author, I alone am responsible for any defects.

\section*{Advice about using these notes}
\begin{enumerate}
\item These notes presuppose familiarity with the material, concepts,
  and notation of the Heim \amp\ Kratzer textbook.
\item There are numerous exercises throughout the notes. It is highly
  recommended to do all of them and it is certainly necessary to do so
  if you at all anticipate doing semantics-related work in the future.
\item The notes are designed to go along with explanatory lectures.
  You should ask questions and make comments as you work through the
  notes.
\item Students with semantic ambitions should also at an early point
  start reading supplementary material (as for example listed at the
  end of each chapter of these notes).
\item Lastly, prospective semanticists may start thinking about how
  \emph{they} would teach this material.
\end{enumerate}

A note about the lecture notes:

\plainbreak{1} 

The notes for this course have been evolving for years now, starting with some old notes from the early 1990s by Angelika Kratzer, Irene Heim, and myself, which have since been modified and expanded every year by Irene or myself. Because this version of the notes has not been seen by my co-author, I alone am responsible for any defects.

This is a work in progress. We may eventually publish these materials as a follow-up volume to Heim \amp\ Kratzer's \textit{Semantics in Generative Grammar}, Blackwell 1998. In the meantime, we encourage the use of these notes in courses at other institutions. Of course, you need to give full credit to the authors and you may not use the notes for any commercial purposes. If you use the notes, we would like to be notified and we would very much appreciate any comments, criticism, and advice on these materials. We have already profited from feedback sent in by several people who have used the notes and the more the better.

\section*{Advice about using these notes}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item These notes presuppose familiarity with the material, concepts, and notation of the Heim \amp\ Kratzer textbook. 
	\item There are numerous exercises throughout the notes. It is highly recommended to do all of them and it is certainly necessary to do so if you at all anticipate doing semantics-related work in the future. 
	\item At the moment, the notes are designed to go along with explanatory lectures. You should ask questions and make comments as you work through the notes. 
	\item Students with semantic ambitions should also at an early point start reading supplementary material (as for example listed at the end of each chapter of these notes). 
	\item Lastly, prospective semanticists may start thinking about how \emph{they} would teach this material. 
\end{enumerate}
